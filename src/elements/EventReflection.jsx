      `This event was available only for our members as a welcome event. We celebrated Trifon Zarezan together with a wine tasting event. It involved sampling and evaluating of different types of wines - 3 red wines and 2 white wines. We put our guests in groups of 2 and they had a list of wines and descriptions which they had to put together after tasting each of the wines. The group with the most right answers won a prize which was a special wine bought from Paris.`,
