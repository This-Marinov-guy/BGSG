          The Bulgarian Society Groningen (BGSG) provides a form for member
          registration. Completion of the registration form will provide the
          individual with a WhatsApp payment request including the yearly
          membership fee of â‚¬5. Once the payment has been received, the new
          member will then be added to the two WhatsApp groups: one for
          discussion of events, and one for communication between members of the
          association. Once individuals have gained membership, they will have
          the ability to join internal events and receive discounts from
          sponsors, receive discounts for open events, and attend all organised
          events.

          At the beginning of each academic year the board and committees make a
          decision to either keep or change the positions, names, committees and
          number of board members. This is done through careful analysis of the
          demand from the previous academic year. Once this has been decided,
          the application process may commence. The existing board will then
          proceed to evaluate applicants through a series of interviews, and
          through this, will select members for the new board. It should be
          noted that board members cannot hold the same role for two consecutive
          academic years. Once the process of selecting the board members has
          been completed, the members of the committees are selected using the
          same procedure.
